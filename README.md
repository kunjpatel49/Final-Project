# IT202-Big-Project

Forelook app uses 2 sets of data points, if you are looking a review on a movie the New York Times API endpoint is used for critics revies and movie images. (All the data and images in the results shown have copyrights and belong to the New York Times)

Second data point is used to get movies being showed in local cinemas using zipcode or user's location. It has URIs to FandangoÂ© to book tickets. API requires a date as query so all the results shown are real time and up-to-date.

The source for the New York Times API is https://developer.nytimes.com/apis .
The source for the Gracenote API is http://developer.tmsapi.com/docs .
